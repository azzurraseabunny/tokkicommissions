    <p>
      <strong>Terms of Service (General)</strong><br />
      I reserve the right to decline any commission for any reason I deem necessary.<br /><br />

      Commissions are for personal use only. You may use the artwork for profile pictures, banners, or similar purposes, but it may not be used for profit.<br /><br />

      I retain full rights to all artwork I create. Uploading or using my work in any AI engine is strictly prohibited.<br /><br />

      Unless requested otherwise, I may post the finished commission on my social media accounts. I may also include it in my portfolio or commission gallery.<br /><br />

      Listed prices are base prices. The final cost may increase depending on complexity, detail, or additional elements in the commission.<br /><br />

      Reposting is allowed, but please give proper credit: [@tokkiperiwinkle].<br /><br />

      Please be patient. I may have other commitments such as school, other projects, or personal time. You’re always welcome to ask for updates! I typically send progress updates when I can or feel like it.<br /><br />

      Please provide visual references (e.g. character sheets, pose ideas, even rough doodles) — anything that can help me better understand your request and avoid mistakes.<br /><br />

      <strong>Terms of Service (Payment)</strong><br />
      Payments are accepted through PayPal only. I will send an invoice.<br /><br />

      A non-refundable deposit of at least 50% is required before I start working. After the sketch is approved, the remaining balance must be paid in full before I continue and finish the commission.<br /><br />

      If you cancel after paying the deposit but before sketch approval, a partial refund may be issued. I will keep at least 25% of the total price.<br /><br />

      If I am unable to complete the commission, I will issue a partial refund based on the work done. Again, at least 25% of the total cost will be retained to cover my time and effort.<br /><br />

      Respectful communication is expected. Rude, aggressive, or inappropriate behavior will result in cancellation. In that case, I will refund 50% and keep the other 50% as compensation.<br /><br />

      <strong>Terms of Service (Post-Payment)</strong><br />
      Once I begin, I’ll send progress shots of the sketch (and flat colors if needed) for your approval or revisions. After the sketch is approved, refunds will no longer be available unless I decide to cancel the commission myself.<br /><br />

      When the final piece is done, I’ll send a final preview. You can request up to three (3) minor revisions. Any further revisions beyond that will require an additional fee, which must be paid before I make the changes.<br /><br />

      Once the artwork is approved, I will email you the high-resolution .PNG files and watermarked .JPGs suitable for posting.
